In the step-by-step process of completing the assignment, I first completed the general page structure. Then to plan the details, I used the vue framework. I thought this framework would be simpler to make the page, then in further completing the design of A4 I found that the music player made me unsure of where to put it, I thought it would be more convenient to have a music player that the user could turn off on the fly. So I repositioned it on the side of the page. 

I was browsing through the 2017brief and noticed that there was a request for a timer, so I made a timer page to help us keep track of time better. On the history screen, I envisage that you can view your most recent view, so you won't be afraid to forget which page you're looking for when you're looking for information. On the main page, we can see the latest news so that users can take note of what has happened recently. Below the news is the most recent date of the course, which allows the user to quickly access the course. 

I did a survey and found that many people are often confused about their task scheduling and don't know when to complete a task, so I set up a task list page where you can have an assessment of your own tasks, which helps users to organise their time wisely. 
In this screen of the task list, you can add your most recent assignments. You can delete your most recently completed assignments. The system will grade your assignments in terms of the time you have spent on them. It also analyses which assignments you should complete first based on dues day.
In the library interface, our system will recommend books based on your chosen course, which will allow you to learn additional knowledge
In the course screen, in addition to the link to today's course at the top, the material for each course is also placed in an easy to click on place
On the message page, I have set up the ability to select emails for different courses, as sometimes users have a lot of emails but it can be time consuming to find the course email they want, so it makes it easier for them to find the email they want.
In the TEAM interface. I have arranged each group team of users. The corresponding tasks for the corresponding teams are presented on top. This way you can not only see your group members, but you can also adjust them to the content of the task at any time
On the dashboard page, there are daily lessons to remind students of the lessons and a lesson summary for your own prep. In addition I have put an extra calendar on the side so that I can remind myself of today's lessons
