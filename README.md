In the step-by-step process of completing the assignment, I first completed the general page structure. Then to plan the details, I used the vue framework. I thought this framework would be simpler to make the page, then in further completing the design of A4 I found that the music player made me unsure of where to put it, I thought it would be more convenient to have a music player that the user could turn off on the fly. So I repositioned it on the side of the page. I was browsing through the 2017brief and noticed that there was a request for a timer, so I made a timer page to help us keep track of time better. On the history screen, I envisage that you can view your most recent view, so you won't be afraid to forget which page you're looking for when you're looking for information. On the main page, we can see the latest news so that users can take note of what has happened recently. Below the news is the most recent date of the course, which allows the user to quickly access the course. I did a survey and found that many people are often confused about their task scheduling and don't know when to complete a task, so I set up a task list page where you can have an assessment of your own tasks, which helps users to organise their time wisely.
